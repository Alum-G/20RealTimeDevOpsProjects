# 20RealTimeDevOpsProjects
In this repository I will work on 20 different real time DevOps Projects as I take a bold attempt to go from zero to hero in my DevOps Journey.

Every step of this journey will be documented in this repo 

Projects were inspired by Imran Teli's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/103WIY3@DPtxXFfSgj6UpXM4njNqyiW3iFiCfBJ6uypHahCHh38B8UzVJpsSWAu42e_V4zD95w==/">20 Real time DevOps Project</a> on Udemy

I'm very open to feedback, corrections, collaborations and any form of advice on this journey  

If you have made a fork with substantial modifications that you feel may be useful, then please open a new issue on GitHub with a link and short description.
